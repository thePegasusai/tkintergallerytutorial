Here's an example of how you could build a Python backend for a Tkinter app to create a video gallery from videos stored in a local directory

In this example, the select_directory function opens a file dialog that allows the user to select a directory. The list_videos function lists all videos (i.e., files with the .mp4 or .avi extension) in the selected directory. The create_gallery function creates a video gallery from the videos, but this function is currently a placeholder and you would need to implement it to match your specific requirements and setup.

The Tkinter GUI code creates a window with a label, an entry widget, a "Select Directory" button, and a "Create Gallery" button. The "Select Directory" button calls the select_directory function and inserts the selected directory into the entry widget. The "Create Gallery" button calls the create_gallery function with the selected directory and the list of videos.
